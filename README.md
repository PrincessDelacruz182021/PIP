### I have created new version of PIP from my extended project of BABAERON Framework. I called it Lavalust Framework. I used Codeigniter styles and some of its keywords but different classes content. I will soon make it public so that others could use it and contribute for its development. By the way, it was not intended for large industry projects for I made it simple as possible as part of my teaching methods especially in OOP MVC pattern.
